    "\n",
    "Classes allow you to create custom *types*, for storing data and doing other kinds of clever things.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Fun fact:** Every variable and data structure that you have seen so far in Python, is in-fact implemented as a class.\n",
    "\n",
    "A class is defined with the keyword `class`. It is standard practice to name classes with an uppercase letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every class also needs to have a constructor function. This is always called `__init__`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__init__()` function is used to assign values to the variables of the object when the object is created. This function is automatically called when a new object of that class is created (aka instantiated)."
