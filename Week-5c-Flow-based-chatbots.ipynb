    "# Week 5c: Flow based chatbots\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the third notebook for this week. Using your knowledge from the two previous notebooks you will be tasked with making flow-based chatbots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flow-base chatbots are the simplest form you can make using code. They follow pre-defined conversation paths, which is something that you can create easily using **if statements** that you have just had some practice with in the last notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you have ever interacted with a customer service chatbot, or a simple slack-bot or other social media bot, then there is a good chance that this was built as a flow-based chatbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this week you have to make three different flow based chatbots of increasing complexity. \n",
    "\n",
    "These exercises are designed for you to learn coding from scratch. I strongly advise that you **do not use ChatGPT or other AI assistant to help you with coding for these exercises**. The only effective way to learn how to code is by writing it yourself and learning how to fix it when things go wrong. If you use AI now, you will not be practicing any of these important skills that you will need later on as you go further into the course."

    "## Task 1: How are you chatbot\n",
    "\n",
    "The first task is to make a simple chatbot that asks the user how they are and responds accordingly. The dialog and flow of conversation is given in the flow-chart:\n",

    "![media/week-2/task-1-how-are-you-bot.png](media/week-2/task-1-how-are-you-bot.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tasks**\n",
    "1. Make a new Python file in VSCode called `how_are_you_bot.py`. \n",
    "2. Open this file.\n",
    "3. Copy and paste the following into the first line of code:\n",
    "```\n",
    "response = input('Hi, how are you?\\n')\n",
    "```\n",
    "> **Note:** `\\n` is the way we represent the new-line character in Python strings code. This allows us the computer to put a new line in the string when it gets printed out without actually starting a new line and confusing the computer. \n",
    "You should put `\\n` at the end of all of the things your chatbot says in the `input()` function, so that the user can put there response on a new line. \n",
    "4. Write the rest of the code using **if statements**, to follow precisely what is specified in the flow chat.\n",
    "5. Once you have finished coding you need to test your chatbot. Can you recreate the following conversations:\n",
    "   \n",
    "> Bot: Hi, how are you?\n",
    "> \n",
    "> User: good\n",
    "> \n",

    "1. Make a new Python file in VSCode called `magic-8-ball.py`. \n",
    "2. Open this file.\n",
    "3. Copy and paste the following into the first line of code:\n",
    "```\n",
    "import random\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. The next line of code should print out 'Hello, I am the magic 8-ball.'\n",
    "2. You then need to use the `input()` function to ask the user a question and get their response.\n",
    "3. You now need to use [the function random.randint(start, stop)](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_random_randint.asp) to generate a random Int between 1 and 6.\n",
    "4. Use **if-else** statements to give a generated response for each generated number as specified in the flow chart.\n",
    "5. Test your chatbot several times to see different responses from it. \n",
    "6. Move onto part 2\n",
